## Description

This project involves implementing a webpage from scratch, based on a design provided in Figma. The goal is to focus on building the HTML structure using semantic tags, with no styling or CSS involved. You'll create a complete webpage by following a step-by-step process, focusing on accuracy and correct usage of HTML tags.

The repository contains the completed HTML code for each section of the page, including the header, banner, quote, videos list, membership section, FAQ, and footer.

## Project Structure

The `html_advanced` directory includes the following files:

- `README.md` - This file that provides an overview and guidance for the project.
- `index.html` - The fully implemented webpage built from the [Figma design file](https://www.figma.com/design/XrEAsu1vQj5fhVaNG38d2W/Homepage?node-id=0-1&node-type=canvas&t=LwyPndsDJdqhhPwf-0).

### Project steps

| Steps                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0. README and Objectives | Create a webpage from a Figma design file, focusing solely on the semantic HTML structure without any CSS or styling, and write a high-quality README.md for the project.                                                                           |
| 1. Header                | Build the HTML skeleton (html, head, body, etc.) and add a header with a link and an image inside, plus a block of three links.                                                                                                                     |
| 2. Banner                | Implement a main tag with a section containing two blocks: the first block includes a level 1 heading, text, and a button, and the second contains a level 2 heading and four sub-blocks with images, headings, and text.                           |
| 3. Quote                 | Add a quote section beneath the banner, with a block containing an image and another block that includes a blockquote tag, a text tag for the quote author, and additional text.                                                                    |
| 4. Videos                | Create a section with a level 1 heading, a block of four video blocks, each with an image, a level 2 heading, and text. Add another block for author information with an image, a level 3 heading, and a block for rating (using images for stars). |
| 5. Membership            | Add a new section after the video list, containing a level 1 heading and four block items, each with an image, a level 2 heading, text, and a button.                                                                                               |
| 6. FAQ                   | Create a FAQ section with a level 1 heading, followed by two "row blocks," each containing two "item blocks" with a level 2 heading and text.                                                                                                       |
| 7. Footer                | Add the footer section outside the main, after the last content section. It includes a block for centering the footer content, with another block containing an image and three linked images along with text.                                      |

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, the following concepts are thoroughly understood:

- **HTML**: In-depth understanding of HTML as the foundation for structuring web content, with knowledge of the proper use of tags such as headings, paragraphs, links, and images.
- **HTML Page Creation**: Ability to translate wireframes into fully structured HTML pages using appropriate semantic tags.
- **Markup Language**: Understanding HTML as a markup language, used for annotating documents and defining the structure and semantics of web content.
- **DOM (Document Object Model)**: Familiarity with the DOM as an interface representing a webpage's structure as a tree of objects, allowing dynamic content manipulation via scripts.
- **Elements and Tags**: Proficiency in working with elements (tags, content, and attributes), and understanding their roles, such as headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`), images (`<img>`), and groupings (`<div>`, `<ul>`).
- **Attributes**: Understanding the role of attributes, which define additional properties or behaviors for HTML elements (e.g., `class="header"`, `src="image.jpg"`).

This project ensures a strong foundation for building and structuring websites using HTML, essential for future web development tasks.
