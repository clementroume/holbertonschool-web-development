## Description

This project involves implementing the styles of a webpage from scratch, based on a design provided in Figma. The focus is on applying CSS to achieve a pixel-perfect design. A visually accurate webpage is created by following a step-by-step process, using the HTML structure developed in the **HTML Advanced** project.

The repository contains the updated CSS styles applied to the original HTML, completing the entire webpage's design, including the header, banner, quote, videos list, membership section, FAQ, and footer.
